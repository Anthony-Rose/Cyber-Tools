# Cyber-Tools

DestroyGen.py -
Python command-line tool that utilizes the PyModBus library to disable an electric generator via the power bit on an ICS/SCADA registry.  
The tool takes the ip, port, and power registry bit of a ICS/SCADA server in order to cycle the power at 7 second increments. 
I was inspired to write this tool after completing the ICS/SCADA rooms on TryHackMe.


clientside and serverside reverse shells - 
reverse shell, hardcoded for port 443
